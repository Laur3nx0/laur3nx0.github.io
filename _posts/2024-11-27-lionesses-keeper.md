# Beating out the likes of Ellie Roebuck and Khiara Keeting, who is Anna Moorhouse, and how did she make her way into the recent Lionesses squad?

Anna Victoria Moorhouse, born March 30th 1995 is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeepr for Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL).

She is one of the most recent call-ups to the Lionesses senior squad, receiving the call on 1st July 2024 for the UEFA EURO 2025 qualifiers.

## Senior Career
### 2022 - Orlando Pride
Moorhouse signed with the NWSL team to ultimately become their first choice keeper over the former starter, Ashlyn Harris. The first choice spot wasn't handed to her however, she had to work hard to beat out Erin McLeod and Kaylie Collins.

Anna was given her first opportunity in the 2022 NWSL Challenge Cup game against Gotham FC, which ended 1-0 to Gotham FC. Moorhouse started a further two games in McLeod's absence, suffering further defeats to Washington Spirit and North Carolina Courage. Anna was subsequently benched to make way for Kaylie Collins. In total, Anna only made five appearances during her debut season at the club, all defeats.

Following McLeods departure at the end of the 2022 season, Moorhouse became the starting keeper for the 2023 season. The first two games of the season resulted in more losses for Orlando Pride, resulting in the benching of Moorhouse for three subsequent games. Moorhouse eventually earned her first clearsheet in her ninth appearance of the season in a 1-0 win against Racing Louisville FC. 

During the following 2024 season, Moorhouse played every game and set a new NWSL record for clean sheets in a single season with 13, beating out Adrianna Franch's record of 11 with Portland Thorns (2017). Orlando Pride went on to win the NWSL Shield and NWSL Championship for the first time, setting records for a new NWSL regular season unbeaten streak of 27 matches, and most wins in an NWSL season (18). 

### 2020 - 2022 Bordeaux
In 2020 Moorhouse signd as a free agent with Bordeaux who had lost their starting choice keeper, Erin Nayler. Whilst at Bordeaux, Anna got the opportunity to train with her former Arsenal coach, Pedro Martinez Losa. Anna took on the first choice keeper role for the French side, playing 20 out of 22 league games. Her 10 clean sheets and 15 goals conceded helped the side finish third in the league, thus allowing them to qualify for the UEFA Women's Champions League for the first time in the clubs history.

The appointment of Patrice Lair in 2021 saw Moorhouse become relegated to backup keeper once more behind Mylene Chavas, resulting in her leaving the club in January 2022.

### 2018 - 2020 West Ham United
In summer 2018, Anna left Arsenal, looking to make more first-team opportunities she landed at newly promoted WSL side, West Ham United. Moorhouse made 10 league starts, splitting goalkeeper duties with Rebecca Spencer making up the remaining 10 league matches. 

Moorhouse ultimately fell to backup keeper behind newly recruited Irish keeper, Courtney Brosnan in 2019-2020. Anna played four league games and four league cup games before leaving at the end of the season.

### 2017 - 2018 Arsenal
A significant highlight in Moorhouse's career came during her time at Arsenal. She signed with the club in February 2017 and went on to win the 2017-2018 FA WSL cup as a member of the team. This trophy marked her first major silverware and established her as a promising talent in English women's football.

### 2016 - 2017 Doncaster Rovers Belles
Anna made her first league WSL debut with Doncaster Rovers Belles, competing for minutes against first choice keeper, Nicola Hobbs. During her only season with the Belles, Anna made a total of four appearances for the side before their relegation to the second division.

### 2014 - 2015 Durham
Anna joined the newly formed second division WSL side, Durham and made a total of 15 appearances over 2 seasons with the club.

### 2012 - 2013 Everton
Moorhouse made her first senior career move to Everton and remained here for two seasons, despite not making an appearance in net for the side who favoured Rachel Brown and Danielle Hill over her in her first season.

## International Experience Breakdown
Hannah Hampton, Mary Earps, and Anna Moorhouse each tell a different story of international goalkeeping ambition. While Earps has been the undisputed number since 2021, Moorhouse and Hampton are fighting for recognition.

## Tactical Evolution
The modern goalkeeper is no longer just a last line of defense but a crucial playmaker. Moorhouse exemplifies this trend, demonstrating exceptional distribution skills and the ability to initiate attacks from deep. Her comfort with playing out from the back mirrors the tactical innovations that Sarina Wiegman has been implementing in the Lionesses' strategy.
